#Vets.gov Content Style Guide

###Introduction
When writing for Vets.gov, it's important to think about users — veterans and their families. Vets.gov’s language is clear and direct, yet its tone is warm and quiet. We respect Veterans’ time, so we get to the point. 

Vets.gov uses plain language — familiar words, simple sentences, and manageable chunks of information so that veterans and their families can access the information that they need. 

+ We don’t say **utilize** when **use** works just as well.  
+ We avoid saying **manifested**, because **started** says it better.  

Our goal is to give Veterans and their families the information they need to make important decisions confidently and easily.

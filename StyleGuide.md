# Style Guide

These are notes for a style guide in the near future.
We want to make sure to document any inconsistencies and make uniform decisions as we develop these best practices.
For each section we may want to include a mini description or reason behind some of these design decisions. 
It would be nice to use findings and quotes from usability tests.

Feel free to edit these.

Source Sans Pro is an open-source sans serif typeface created for legibility in UI design. With a variety of weights that read easily at all sizes, Source Sans Pro provides clear headers as well as highly-readable body text.

Inspired by twentieth-century American gothic typeface design, its slender but open letters offer a clean and friendly simplicity. Advanced hinting allows Source Sans Pro to render well on Windows systems which run Cleartype, and across browsers and devices. Moreover, it supports a variety of languages and alphabets, including Western and European language, Vietnamese, pinyin Romanization of Chinese, and Navajo.

## Typesetting

Readable text allows users to efficiently read and take in textual information, whereas text that is not readable turns off readers or makes it challenging for them to stay focused. The following guidelines promote good readability.

### Heading

Content heading 1 and 2 are reserved for the vets.gov header and breadcrumb navigation.

<div class="va-text-sans">
	<h3>Heading 3</h3>
	<h4>Heading 4</h4>
	<h5>Heading 5</h5>
	<h6>Heading 6</h6>
</div>

## Alignment

Type set flush left provides the eye a constant starting point for each line, making text easier to read.

<div class="va-rr-example">
    <h4>The Grand Canyon</h4>
    <p>Grand Canyon National Park is the United States' 15th oldest national park. Named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979, the park is located in Arizona.</p>
</div>
  
## Line Length

Controlling the length of lines of text in extended copy makes reading more comfortable by helping readersâ€™ eyes flow easily from one line to the next. Somewhere between 50 and 75 characters per line is broadly considered to be a readable line length, while 66 characters is considered the ideal. Other factors beyond line length also affect reading comfort. Text with more space between lines can have somewhat longer line length. Also, contexts in which users will not be reading long passages of text (such as footnotes or alerts) can safely be set with somewhat longer lines as well.

## Buttons

### Primary

#### Apply

With subtle rounded edge and friendly color, the Vets.gov green button is approachable to all users who are looking to learn more about eligibility and apply for various benefits. Designers and writers are advised to use actionable words so that users can anticipate the next steps to a process. Green buttons are commonly used to apply for benefits and can found at the <a href="https://www.vets.gov/disability-benefits/claims-process/">top right corner</a> or <a href="https://www.vets.gov/disability-benefits/">bottom left corner</a> of the body copy, depending on other page elements such as piano keys or side navigation.

### Secondary

While the primary button has a stronger weight and bolder color, the secondary button uses the white space to build contrast for a userâ€™s task. The Vets.gov secondary button is commonly used in forms or pages with multiple actionable items.

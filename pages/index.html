    <p class="va-rr-jumbotron-body">Roadrunner was designed to help the Digital Service team at the VA and Digital Service partners including VA employees and contractors build projects that will be migrated into Vets.gov and Appeals. The purpose of this open source style guide is to standardize our products, scale out team, and accelerate our deliveries. When building a new app, team members can use the Roadrunner Github and help continue to build and upgrade the repository. </p>

    <p>Today, the VA customer experience is fragmented, frustrating and confusing. Customers can&#8217;t find the information they need when they need it.</p>
    <p>But their wants are simple. They desire:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Useful information that&#8217;s clearly written and presented, and;</li>
      <li>Tools that are easy to find and use.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The new vets.gov intends to deliver both.</p>
